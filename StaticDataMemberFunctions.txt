Static Data member and member functions:
Static data member and member functions are special because they belong to class only, not any object.

Static Data Members:
1. Declared using static keyword inside the class.
2. Memory is allocated only once.
3. Used to store common data for all objects.
4. Must be defined outside the class.

Example for static data member:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    static int totalStudents;  // declaration

    Student() {
        totalStudents++;       // increment shared variable
    }
};

int Student::totalStudents = 0;  // definition

int main() {
    Student s1, s2, s3;
    cout << "Total students: " << Student::totalStudents;  // Access using class name
    return 0;
}


Output: 
Total students: 3

Static Member Functions:

1. Can be called without creating an object.
2. Can only access static data members (not normal members).
3. Cannot use this pointer.

Example for static member functions:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student {
public:
    static int totalStudents;
    
    static void showCount() {     // static function
        cout << "Total students: " << totalStudents << endl;
    }
};

int Student::totalStudents = 5;

int main() {
    Student::showCount();  // No need to create object
    return 0;
}

Output:
Total students: 5
