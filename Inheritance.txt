Inheritance in CPP:
    1. The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called inheritance.
    2. Inheritance is one of the most important features of object-oriented programming.
    3. Inheritance decreases code redundancy and increases code reusability.

Syntax:

    class Base_class{

    };

    class Derived_class : Visibility_Mode Base_class{

    };

Types of inheritance:
    1. Single Inheritance
    2. Multilevel Inheritance
    3. Multiple Inheritance
    4. Hierarchical Inheritance
    5. Hybrid Inheritance

Single Inheritance:

    In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class.

    Syntax:

    class A{

    };

    class B : public A{

    };


   Base
     |
     v
  Derived


Multilevel Inheritance:

    Syntax:

    class C{

    };

    class B: public C{

    };

    class A: public B{

    };

   A (Base)
      |
      v
   B (Derived from A)
      |
      v
   C (Derived from B)


Multiple Inheritance:

    Syntax:

    class B{

    };

    class C{

    };

    class A: public B, public C{

    };

   A       B
    \     /
     \   /
      \ /
     Derived


Hierarchical Inheritance:

    class A{

    };
    class B: public A{

    };
    class C: public A{

    };
    class D: public B{

    };
    class E: public B{

    };
    class F: public C{

    };
    class G: public C{

    };

        Base
       /    \
      v      v
 Derived1  Derived2

Hybrid(Virtual) Inheritance:

Combinationation of two or more type of inheritance.



Mode of Inheritance:

Public Mode:
    If we derive a subclass from a public base class, then the public member of the base 
    class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class 
    will become protected in the derived class.

    Example:

    class Base {
    public:
        int a;
    protected:
        int b;
    private:
        int c;
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void fun() {
            a = 10;   // ✔ accessible
            b = 20;   // ✔ accessible
            // c = 30;  // ❌ not accessible
        }
    };

    Effect on members:

    Base Member      In Derived
    --------------------------------
    public     →     public
    protected  →     protected
    private    →     NOT accessible


    Diagram:

    Base:   public ----> public   (in Derived)
            protected -> protected
            private ---X--> (hidden)


Protected Mode:
    If we derive a subclass from a protected base class, then the public and protected members
    of the base class will become protected in derived class.

    Example:

    class Derived : protected Base {
        void fun() {
            a = 10;   // was public, now protected ✔
            b = 20;   // protected ✔
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Derived d;
        // d.a;  // ❌ not accessible (became protected)
    }

    Effect on members:

    Base Member      In Derived
    --------------------------------
    public     →     protected
    protected  →     protected
    private    →     NOT accessible

    Diagram:

    Base: public ------> protected
          protected ---> protected
          private ---X-> hidden


Private Mode:
    If we derive a subclass from a private base class, then the public and protected members
    of the base class will become private in derived class.

    Example:

    class Derived : private Base {
    public:
        void fun() {
            a = 10;   // was public, now private ✔
            b = 20;   // was protected, now private ✔
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Derived d;
        // d.a;  // ❌ now private, cannot be accessed
    }

    Effect on members:

    Base Member      In Derived
    --------------------------------
    public     →     private
    protected  →     private
    private    →     NOT accessible

    Diagram:

    Base: public ------> private
          protected ---> private
          private ---X-> hidden


Clean Summary Table:

    Inheritance Type | Base public → | Base protected → | Base private →
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    public           | public         | protected        | inaccessible
    protected        | protected      | protected        | inaccessible
    private          | private        | private          | inaccessible


How Constructor and Destructor works in Inheritance:

1. Base class constructor runs first because cpp builds objects from parent to child.
2. Derived class destructor runs first because cpp destroys objects from child to parent.


Examples:

Constructor Example:

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Base{
        public:
        Base(){ cout<<"Base class constructor\n";}
    };

    class Derived: public Base{
        public:
        Derived(){ cout<<"Derived class constructor\n";}
    };
    int main(){
        Derived d;
        return 0;
    }

    Output:
    Base class constructor
    Derived class constructor

Destructor Example:

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Base{
        public:
        ~Base(){ cout<<"Base class destructor\n";}
    };

    class Derived: public Base{
        public:
        ~Derived(){ cout<<"Derived class destructor\n";}
    };
    int main(){
        Derived d;
        return 0;
    }

    Output:
    Derived class destructor
    Base class destructor

Rules for parameterized constructor:

    1. If parameterized constructor is in base class then it must be called explicitly.

Example:

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Base{
        public:
        Base(int x){ cout<<"Base class constructor\n";}
    };

    class Derived: public Base{
        public:
        Derived():Base(10){   //must call Base(int)
            cout<<"Derived class constructor\n";
        }
    };
    int main(){
        Derived d;
        return 0;
    }

    Output:
    Derived class constructor
    Base class constructor

If we forgot to call the parameterized constructor explicitly, it will be a compilation error.

error: constructor for 'Derived' must explicitly initialize the base class 'Base' which does not have a default constructor
   10 |     Derived(){   //must call Base(int)
      |     ^
/Users/mayur/Desktop/C++Projects/class.cpp:3:7: note: 'Base' declared here
    3 | class Base{
      |       ^

Multiple Inheritance Constructor Order:

    Order for constructor is based on inhertance list.

    Example:

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Base1{
        public:
        Base1(){ cout<<"Base1 class constructor\n";}
    };

    class Base2{
        public:
        Base2(){   //must call Base(int)
            cout<<"Base2 class constructor\n";
        }
    };

    class Derived:public Base1, public Base2{ //if this os Base2,Base1 then order would be Base2->Base1->Derived 
        public:
        Derived(){
            cout<<"Derived class constructor\n";
        }
    };

    int main(){
        Derived d;
        return 0;
    }

    Output:
    Base1 class constructor
    Base2 class constructor
    Derived class constructor
