Destructor in CPP:

1. Destructor is an instance member fuction which is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed.
2. This means that a destructor is the last function that is going to be called before an object is destroyed.
3. Destructor also has the same name as their class name preceded by the tiled symbol (~).
4. It is not possible to define more than one destructor.
5. Destructor neither requires any arguement nor returns any value.
6. It is automatically called when object goes out of scope.
7. Destructor releases memory occupied by the objects created by contructors.
8. It cannot be declared static or const.
9. Destructor should be declared in the public section of a class.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    int *p;

    public:
    A(){
        p = new int;
        cout<< "Constructor of A \n";
    }
    ~A(){
        delete p;
        cout<< "Destructor of A \n";
    }

};

int main() {
    A obj;
    return 0;
}
