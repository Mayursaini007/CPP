this Pointer in CPP:

    1. this is an implicit pointer inside every non-static member function.
    2. It always points to the object that called the function.
    3. It is a way of cpp to tell a member function "Hey, you’re currently working on this object — here is its address."
    4. It is a const pointer, meaning you cannot change where it points 

Why do we need it?

    1. To access data members from current objects explicitly.
        Normally we write:
            x = 5;
        But internally it's actually:
            this->x = 5;

    2. To resolve naming conflicts.
        When constructor parameters have the same name as member variables.
        Example:
        #include<iostream>
        using namespace std;
        class A{
            int x;
            public:
            A(int x){
                this->x = x; //resolves confusion and tells the compiler that this->x represents the member valriable while x represents the constructor parameter.
            }

        };
        int main(){
            A obj(10);
            return 0;
        }
    
    3. To return current object.
        Example:
        class Box {
            int h;
        public:
            Box& setHeight(int h) {
                this->h = h;
                return *this;
            }
        };

Final example for undersstanding:

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Student{
        int age;
        public:
        Student(int age){
            this->age = age;
            cout<<"Object is at address "<<this<<endl;
        }
        void show(){
            cout<<"Age = "<<this->age<<" from object at address "<<this<<endl;
        }
    };
    int main(){
        Student s1(20);
        Student s2(21);

        s1.show();
        s2.show();
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Object is at address 0x16bd4ed98
    Object is at address 0x16bd4ed94
    Age = 20 from object at address 0x16bd4ed98
    Age = 21 from object at address 0x16bd4ed94
