Constructor in CPP:

1. Constructor in cpp is a special method that  is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
2. It is used to initialize the data members of the new objects.
3. The constructor in cpp has same name as the class ort the structure. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is called a constructor.
4. Contructor does not have a return value, hence they don't have a return type.
5. Constructor must be placed in the public section of a class. However they can also be private.
6. If we do not specify a constructor, cpp compiler generates a default constructor for object (expects no parameters and has an empty body).
7. Default contructors don't have any input arguments however, copy and parameterized constructors have input arguments.
8. There are three types of contructors:
    1. Default ---> Class_name()
    2. Parameterized  ---> Class_name(parameters)
    3. Copy ---> Class_name(const Class_name old_object)


Example (Default Constructor):

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int rno;
    char name[10];
    double fee;

    public:
    Student(){
        cout<< "We can take the student details here";
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    return 0;
}

Output: 
We can take the student details here

Example (Parameterized constructor):
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int x;
    int y;

    public:
    Student(){
        cout<< "We can take the student details here";
    }
    Student(int a, int b){
        cout<<"This is a parameterized constructor"<<endl;
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
    Student(int a, float b){
        cout<<"This is an example of constructor overloading"<<endl;
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s(1, 2);
    Student s1(1, 2.0f);
    return 0;
}


Constructors can also be overloaded, same as we can overload function. Above example inlcludes both parameterized constructor and constructor overloading.

Important Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int x;
    int y;

    public:
    Student(int a, int b){
        cout<<"This is a parameterized constructor"<<endl;
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
    Student(int a, float b){
        cout<<"This is an example of constructor overloading"<<endl;
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    Student s1(1, 2);
    Student s2(1, 2.0f);
    return 0;
}

Output:
This will give a compilation error. If we are defining parameterized contructors then we need to explicitly define a default contructor in order for this code to work.
